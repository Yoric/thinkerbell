/// application) executed on the server.

/// Monitor applications are typically used for triggering an action
/// in reaction to an event: changing temperature when night falls,
/// ringing an alarm when a door is opened, etc.

/// Monitor applications are installed from a paired device. They may
/// either be part of a broader application (which can install them
/// through a web/REST API) or live on their own.
